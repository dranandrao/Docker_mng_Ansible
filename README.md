# Docker_mng_Ansible
Managing Dockers using automation tool Ansible


Docker is the most popular file format for Linux-based container development and deployments. It is an open platform for developing, shipping, and running applications. Docker enables you to separate your applications from your infrastructure, so you can deliver software quickly.
When used in brand-new environments, Docker containers can be managed easily. But it can be a challenge to manage Docker containers along with tools which are required to manage IT environments. With the help of a powerful tool like Ansible, this problem can be easily solved. Ansible is an IT automation engine that handles tasks such as automating configuration management, application deployment, intra-service orchestration.
Ansible helps in automation of building docker containers and in the deployment process. It can not only manage the containers, but also the environments around the containers. Docker containers run on hosts which need to be launched, configured, networked, and coordinated, whether they are local machines or full cloud infrastructures.


Objective of the project:

The objective of the project is to deploy Docker Container having Ubuntu 16.04 as the base image to host computers with the help of Ansible. Also, Ansible will be used to install Nginx and MySQL servers on the docker containers.
